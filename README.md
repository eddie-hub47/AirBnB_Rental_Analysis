### Exploratory Data Analysis

- Where is the best location to invest in AirBnB busines?

### Results

The analysis of the results are summerized as follows:
1. It is evident that the best location to invest in AirBnB business is in Industrial District of Seattle, Washington as it has the highest ROI when correlated with the average price per bedroom.
2. The best time of the year to list out apartment for high returns is within ending of May till ending of June, then begining of November to the New year. These period showed a massive business activities.
3. The analysis showed the one bedroom apartment are highly sourced after by client but the six bedbroom apartment brings higher revenue. This is a function of average price.


### Recommendations

Based on the analysis, we recommend the following actions:
- Invest in industrial district of Seattle
- Target apartment lisiting on the market from begining of summer "Ending of May to ending of June" and the "Novermber to Begining of New year" Those are the period people spend so much on AirBnB.
- Depending on the available capital, you could either invest in one bedroom apartment or in six bedroom apartment. The six bedroom apartment will give a tremedous return on investment.


### Limitation 

- In order to get the price per bedroom, we converted bedroom data from numerical value to meaure names which is converting numerial values to dimension.
- We also removed the null values as it does not add anything to data visualization.
